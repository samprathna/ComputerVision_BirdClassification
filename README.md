# Predictive Modelling, CNN, Classification

I will be using the Bird Species dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/gpiosenka/100-bird-species) 

- Make sure that my Training, Testing AND Validation sets contain the same classes of species
- My validation set is to be used at the very end -- to get a good sense of how my model is performing
- I compiled a CNN in order to correctly classify your selected 15 classes
- It can be beneficial to reshape some of the images to reduce some of the data - this will help speed up your model's training time
- I boosted my model's performance with data augmentation.
